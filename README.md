# CPSC-4030-Project
## Design
This project is implemented using HTML, CSS, JS, and the library d3.js. We utilized publicly available data provided by the Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital. Our group strived to implement this data with the objective of finding correlation between education and opportunity, specifically related to fields such as migration and average life expectancy. We also aimed at demonstrating contrast between male and female levels of education, and how that correlates with fertility. These attributes are grouped by country, continent, and 5 year periods, which is provided in interactions for the user within our site. 

## Known Problems
Functionality of the website seems to cease once you leave the tab which the website is running on. Additionally, we have found some sizing issues can arise on certain web browsers and resolutions in the past, though we believe they are mostly fixed.

## Functionality
Within the site, users can select various countries via any one of the visualizations, which will highlight the country within the other visualizations. Furthermore, users can group by continent via a selector showcasing the color mapping for each continent, and can group by period via the selector in the bottom right that is cycling through upon launch. Upon hovering over any country on the visualizations, a tooltip presenting that country and the currently selected period is displayed, helping the user understand what is currently selected and/or in comparing between different countries.
