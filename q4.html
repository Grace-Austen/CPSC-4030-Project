            This visualization focuses on how education and time spent in school affects the migration rates for certain countries. Along the x axis is the 
            mean years each country's population has spent in school, and along the y axis is the migration rate for our selected year range (2015-2020). This data 
            proposes a correlation between education and migration rates, as there tends to be more spikes as you move right across the x axis. Countrynames are kept anonymous 
            here, to provide an unbiased look at how the two attributes correspond.
